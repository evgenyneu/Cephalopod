This library can help fading sounds in and out with AvAudioPlayer. One can set duration, velocity of the fade and a completion function. Velocity can vary from linear to exponential.

```Swift
cephalopod = Cephalopod(player: player)
cephalopod?.fadeIn()
```

## Setup

There are three ways you can add Cephalopod to your Xcode project.

#### Add source (iOS 7+)

Simply add the [CephalopodDistrib.swift](https://github.com/evgenyneu/Cephalopod/blob/master/Distrib/CephalopodDistrib.swift) file to your project.


#### Setup with Carthage (iOS 8+)

Alternatively, add `github "evgenyneu/Cephalopod" ~> 2.0` to your Cartfile and run `carthage update`.

#### Setup with CocoaPods (iOS 8+)

If you are using CocoaPods add this text to your Podfile and run `pod install`.

```
use_frameworks!
target 'Your target name'
pod 'Cephalopod', '~> 2.0'
```


### Legacy Swift versions

Setup a [previous version](https://github.com/evgenyneu/Cephalopod/wiki/Legacy-Swift-versions) of the library if you use an older version of Swift.



## Usage


The following example shows how to play an mp3 file with a fade in effect.

```Swift
import AVFoundation
import Cephalopod // For CocoaPods and Carthage
// ---

var playerInstance: AVAudioPlayer?
var cephalopod: Cephalopod?

override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()

  // Create a player instance
  guard let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "squid", ofType: "mp3") else { return }
  guard let player = try? AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: URL(fileURLWithPath: path)) else { return }
  playerInstance = player

  // Start audio playback
  player.play()
  player.volume = 0

  // Fade in the sound
  cephalopod = Cephalopod(player: player)
  cephalopod?.fadeIn()
}
```

### Fade in / fade out

```Swift
cephalopod?.fadeIn()
cephalopod?.fadeOut()

// Supply fade duration and velocity, in seconds
cephalopod?.fadeIn(duration: 3, velocity: 2)
cephalopod?.fadeOut(duration: 3, velocity: 2)

// Supply finish closure
cephalopod?.fadeIn(duration: 3, velocity: 2) { finished in }
cephalopod?.fadeOut(duration: 3, velocity: 2)  { finished in }
```

### Supply fade start/end volume and completion callback

```Swift
cephalopod?.fade(fromVolume: 0.3, toVolume: 0.7, duration: 3, velocity: 2) { finished in
  print("Finished fading")
}
```

**Arguments**:

`fromVolume` - the start volume, a number between 0 and 1.

`toVolume` - the end volume, a number between 0 and 1.

`duration` - duration of the fade, in seconds. Default duration: 3 seconds.

`velocity` - a number specifying how fast the sound volume is changing. Velocity of 0 creates a linear fade. Values greater than zero produce more exponential fade affect. Exponential fade sounds more gradual to a human ear. The fade sounds most natural with velocity parameter from 2 to 5. Default value: 2.

`onFinished` - an optional closure that will be called after the fade has ended. The closure will be passed a boolean parameter `finished` indicating whether the fading has reached its end value (`true`) or if the fading has been cancelled (`false`).


### Set the quality of fade

```Swift
cephalopod?.volumeAlterationsPerSecond = 20
```

Larger numbers will produce finer fade effect at expense of CPU juice. Default value: `30`.

### Stop the volume change

One can cancel the ongoing volume change by calling the `stop()` method. Note that it stops changing the volume but does not stop the playback.

```Swift
cephalopod?.stop()
```

## Volume functions

The following graph shows how sound volume changes during the fade.

### Fade out formula

Where `x` is time and `v` is velocity.

Velocity of 0 creates a linear fade. Values greater than zero produce more exponential fade affect. Exponential fade sounds more gradual to a human ear. I personally use velocity values from 2 to 5.
